	<description>Adds two lights which are mounted upon walls. One light produces enough light to grow crops, and one is just a really bright lamp. Pawns can freely walk through the light with no problems.

	[h1]Wall Sun Lamp[/h1]
	Power needed: 600W
	Light radius: 15 squares (plant growing strength)

	[h1]Wall Bright Lamp[/h1]
	Power needed: 50W
	Light radius: 20


	This mod is based on Wall Light by Murmur, but does not require that mod to function. You just won't have a normal wall light.
